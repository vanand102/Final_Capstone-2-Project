# Stroke Data Analysis
===============================

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) strokes are the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. By using stroke data for over 5000 individuals, I created a tool to help predict given certain data point, whether an individual is likely to have a stroke.
